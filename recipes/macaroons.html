        <p>A macaroon (/ˌmækəˈruːn/ MAK-ə-ROON) is a small cake or biscuit, typically made from ground almonds (the original main ingredient[1]), coconut or other nuts (or even potato), with sugar and sometimes flavourings (e.g. honey, vanilla, spices), food colouring, glacé cherries, jam or a chocolate coating;[2] or a combination of these or other ingredients. Some recipes use sweetened condensed milk.[3][4] Macaroons are sometimes baked on edible rice paper placed on a baking tray.</p>
